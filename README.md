## Static map

This is a static map showing the average number of crimes by each postcode using a colorscale. 

This inspired me to try an Interactive version.

## Interactive map for Victorian Crime Statistics in Australia (2012-2016)

![Alt](/Vic_Crimes_2012_2016_by_postcode.gif "Average no. of Crimes (2012-2016)")

You can view the interactive map by downloading the [html file](/VIC_crimes1.html). It is made using folium. 

Downloaded the shape file for the postcode boundaries of the state of Victoria from the [Australian DataVic website](https://www.data.vic.gov.au/data/dataset/postcode-boundaries-polygon-vicmap-admin)

Converted it into json format using pyshp and also [this website](https://mygeodata.cloud/converter/shp-to-json)
